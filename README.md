# Development Journey

I love technology and learning about all things tech. Nothing is too basic for me. I am interested about all things backend, frontend, data, cloud, infrastructure. What happens most of the time during learning is, when learning a new thing, we are introduced to a few more interesting concepts, tools, etc. Most of the time it leads to a recursive researching / learning / trying out into many new things. At the end loose focus and loose track of all the interesting things that should have been in the learning plan. 

This is a starting point to document and track my learning journey. Hope to eventually move this to a appropriate tool which will become a respository of knowlege for myself. 

Below are some areas I need to research, learn and tryout.
